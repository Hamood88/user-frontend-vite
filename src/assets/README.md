This folder contains design assets for the user-frontend-vite app.

Files:
- moondala-logo.svg  — placeholder SVG logo added from the chat attachment.

To replace with your original PNG (from the Figma export or attachment), add your file as:

  src/assets/moondala-logo.png

Then update imports if needed. The `SplitAuthPage` currently imports the SVG at `../assets/moondala-logo.svg`.
